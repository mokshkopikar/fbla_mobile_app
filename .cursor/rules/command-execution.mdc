# Command Execution Preferences

## Long-Running Commands

**DO NOT execute** commands that run indefinitely or start servers. Instead, **ask the user** to run them in their terminal.

### Examples of Long-Running Commands:
- `flutter run -d chrome` - Starts dev server
- `flutter run` - Runs on device/simulator
- `npm start` - Starts development server
- `python manage.py runserver` - Django server
- Any command that starts a server or keeps running

### What to Do Instead:
1. **Identify** that the command is long-running
2. **Ask the user** to copy and paste the command in their terminal
3. **Provide** the exact command they should run
4. **Explain** why (e.g., "This command starts a server that runs indefinitely")

## Quick Commands (OK to Execute)

**DO execute** commands that complete quickly:
- `flutter pub get` - Installs dependencies
- `flutter test` - Runs tests
- `flutter build web` - Builds the app
- `flutter analyze` - Code analysis
- `flutter devices` - Lists devices
- `git status` - Shows git status
- `npm install` - Installs packages
- Any command that completes and returns

## Best Practice

When in doubt, if a command:
- Starts a server → Ask user to run it
- Keeps running indefinitely → Ask user to run it
- Opens a browser/app → Ask user to run it
- Completes in seconds → Execute it
